Holding bin for test files
5.7.24 AJG - Updated PI tab to have Printh 23 02 50 01 so it properly saves upon "Save" and you can begin brewing without restarting the machine.
5.7.24 AJG - Updated back button for Transition to go to Home and used explicit page # instead of bp (Current page) so the More tab went to previous tab properly instead of being stuck.
