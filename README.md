#Gaggiuino Nextion display HMI files

## NEXTION 4.3" DISPLAY, NEXTION 3.5" DISPLAY and NEXTION 2.4"/2.8" DISPLAY

by Steve Nofs
  - *** I am in the process of adding all TFT files 4.3" TFTs have been added ***
  - The Nextion 4.3" must be Intelligent Series to run the 4.3" code.
  - This GitHub repository contains my HMI versions for the Nextion display for use on the Gaggiuino mod of the Gaggia Espresso Machine.
  - My goal was to provide a clean and innovative interface to the STM32 controller while maintaining all functionality of the original HMI coding.
  - What you will find here are my HMI files and compiled TFT files for the 2.4"/2.8", 3.5" and 4.3" Nextion displays.
  - Feel free to give them a try. If for any reason you want to revert back to the original HMI code you can always flash to original code to your display.
  - Enjoy!
